        # Domain Specific Language

        Wikipedia
        - A domain-specific language (DSL) is a computer language specialized to a particular application domain. This is in contrast to a general-purpose language (GPL), which is broadly applicable across domains.

        Characteristics of DSLs are
        - Context
        - Fluency

        Using a language that was designed with a specific problem in mind



        There is a difference in Internal and External DSLs

        # Characteristics of...

        External DSL
        - Own language and syntax
        - Flexibillity
        - Parser needed to interpreate or translate
        - A lot of effort to maintain language and parser
        
        Internal DSL
        - Based on existing Language e. g. Kotlin or Java
        - No parser needed, just use Language Compiler and Runtime
        - Use your favorite IDEA
        - Easy to maintain "by everyone"
        - Syntax constraints
        - Depends on flexibility and fluency of the language

        # Use Cases for DSLs
        Make File (External)

        CSS (External)

        Cucumber (External)

        Selenium || FluentLenium (Internal)

        SQL (External)

        - SELECT Person.name, Person.age FROM Person ORDER BY Person.age DESC

        # Characteristics of Kotlin
        Pragmatic
        - Proven solutions for common task

        Safe
        - Preventing common errors such as NullPointerExceptions
        - Immutability

        Concise
        - Supporting compact and easy-to-read code

        Interoperable
        - Providing unrestricted integration with Java

        ---

        # Hands On
        Kotlin supports several ways to create a cleaner syntax and avoid "noise" in the code

        We will focus on
        - Concise Syntax
        - Use of lambdas
        - Lambdas with receivers
        - Extension functions
